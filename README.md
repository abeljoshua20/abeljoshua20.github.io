When supermassive stars that are about eight times the size of our Sun die, they produce colorful supernovae high in hydrogen and helium, then leave behind either a neutron star or a black hole, if its mass is high enough. A pulsar is a type of neutron star. It is highly magnetized and emits strong radiowaves from both its poles while rotating very fast. On Earth, their emissions are detected as pulses of radiation observed when the beams sweep along the planet’s direction$^{6, 9}$.

Pulsars are valuable, mainly in the fields of cosmology and astrophysics. Specifically in the areas exploring the extreme states of matter, spacecraft navigation, and in more recent developments, gravitational wave detection$^1$.

In the emerging field of gravitational wave astronomy, they deal with the detection of these “ripples” in the fabric of spacetime that convey certain events in the Universe, such as the merging of two black holes$^3$. As a consequence of these distortions, variations in the arrival times of radio signals tend to be observed. To confirm that these detected variations are indeed caused by gravitational waves and not noise, astronomers make use of Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), since the arrival time of their periodic radio pulses can often be accurately predicted$^9$.

In practice, however, the signal received from the radio telescopes are often quite indistinguishable from the ones caused by radiofrequency interferences or actual noise. With modern pulsar surveys producing larger volumes of data by the day, manually identifying pulsars would be overly tedious. Thus, interest in automating the process of pulsar identification is on the rise
